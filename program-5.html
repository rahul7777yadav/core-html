        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB, the most popular NoSQL database, is an open-source document-oriented database. The term ‘NoSQL’ means ‘non-relational’. It means that MongoDB isn’t based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This format of storage is called BSON ( similar to JSON format).</dd>
        <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd>Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.</dd>
        <dt>React.js</dt>
        <dd>ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient way. It is a component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of a <b>Model View Controller(MVC)</b> architecture. React is used to create modular user interfaces and promotes the development of reusable UI components that display dynamic data.</dd>
        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. <b>NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a programming language</b>. Node.js is used to build back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.</dd>
